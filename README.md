# Fullstack Challenge Alice Martin

Vue3 Django fullstack challenge

## Description

Fullstack challenge demonstrating a real estate listing website

### front end
* vue3

### back end
* Django. 
  * Particularly for its robust ORM features considering the timeframe


## Getting Started
Run the front and back independently. 
See the readme's on each for instructions.
After following those instructions, 
you can hit the front end and create a user and login at http://localhost.com:8080

## Bonus/Docs/Notes/lovables
**Many** things I did not have time to do that would be helpful
* Implementing a paging scenario for listings would be optimal and more performant. 
* The UX/UI is marginal at best and would need some love. 
* Dockerizing both the front and back and adding docker-compose files on each would improve ease of use
* I'd suggest using performant database and in this case a document store. 
  * Cassandra would be super fast if we're talking a lot of data. 
  * Possibly postgres for configuration
* eslint, and typescript on the front would be great.
